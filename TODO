##!!gfilter: head/tail/some, 
##??gcheckboxgroup: fix selection on filter..
##??when viewing gdf(), possible to c-menu "copy" cell?
##!!introduce hacky diff() functionality on Merge; check if subset objs are identical; use all.equal() and identical() on subset
##!!reload data.frame button (automatically poll for changes? RStudio-style, maybe when record change in workspace?); bug when modifying a level it doesn't update the filters; bottom-left?; adding new filter should consider merged changes
##!!search for col names
##!!f4 for hide pane + Opera-style handle + increase width when Add item is trigerred 
##!!bug with search auto-select checkboxes not triggering update on label (do we want that?)
##!!toggle button to display only unique matches (can gdf() support this?)
##
##!!check how you can check.names() or whatever to avoid assignment issues
##!!re-run search after changing Opts
##!!display nr of levels for each var
##!!add hide=F, search.opts=list()
##!!have 'prev/next' button for combobox
##!!default include NA: yes for multiple, no for single choice
##??on display button, log subsetting operation in the console
##??what of 5gb dataset or 21297 integer levels: it shouldn't be too slow; if possible use max 1 copy of df; 
##??optimize return() beahviour, confirmation, on-the-fly, discard/save&close button, undo/redo, what about 5gb dataset, display diff before confirm merge, etc.
##??optimize return() beahviour, confirmation, on-the-fly, discard/save&close button, undo/redo, display diff before confirm merge, etc.
##??waht happens when alter 'other' variables (Date & robustness of editor); investigate sapply() thingy & factor editor robustness (strange handling of inserting NA values, especially in 'char' vars)
##??waht happens when alter 'other' variables (& robustness of editor)
##!!investigate cache bug: dffilter(Xa), Xa$var[1:10,] <- NA, dffilter(Xa) without closing first instance. Or dffilter(cbind(Xa, Xb)). 
##??some sort of weird --detach-- pop-up to have more scrolling space to choose column names, and maybe to re-arrange them for displaying purposes. 
##??multiple selection mode (isntead of shift+select on cehckboxes); or via c-menu item "select to here"
##!!start with gfilterpreset of head(.., 1000 )
##??print
##!!export subset ("save as" different obj)

## gfilter TODO items
##!!inspect the gfilter code (logical vector selection, use spinners for 'range' & type-ahead updating of filters, manually update filter items to reflect available choices as a 'update filters' button or 'freeze selection' checkbox?, what happens to 'Date' or 'other' classes, use rgtk2editdf, 'enable/disable filter' toggle button next to 'remove', tweak icons in gedit() search boxes, )
##!!inspect the gfilter code (logical vector selection, use spinners for 'range', head/tail/some/!is.na/na.omit, manually update filter items to reflect available choices as a 'update filters' button or 'freeze selection' checkbox?, what happens to 'Date' or 'other' classes, use rgtk2editdf, 'enable/disable filter' toggle button next to 'remove', )
##!!adding new filter should consider merged changes (auto-polling of data frame?)
##??use fancy search box RStudio/LyX/Xfce-style that filters out the available elements in the filter widgets
##??sort variable components? or use data frame order?
##??sort variable components?
##??gfilterpreset (use c("==", "%in%", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", "<=") combo, logical / manual subset, )
##!!have 'select all/reset' (done) and 'clear' buttons
##??type-ahead search in combobox gfilter and in cehckbox table? (as in LyX?)
##??stringr (for options 'whole word' in search; replacement for grepl(); )

## tangential TODO items
##??data frame selector (use data frame browser; what about matrix objs?) & label(..., self=T) in tooltip and make  label editable & describe() & class() & nchar() & clone obj & save obj as .RData/csv/etc. & 
##??data frame selector (use data frame browser; what about matrix objs?) & label(..., self=T) in tooltip and make  label editable & describe() & class() & nchar() & auto-load on package load & allow to set gtimer(check_digest) on data frames or maybe allow to set polling using digests on specific objects/subsets; debug var with nchar, etc.; allow to compare to variables, even when vars from two different data frames (all.equal()); allow to compare two objects (all.equal()); 
##??sort  & re-order columns (in gdf()? or separately w/o loading the full data frame?; have distinct window)
##??edit data structure: rename & sort & re-order variables/cols, change var type/factors, batch rename cols (tolower), etc. w/o displaying data frame; Deducer-style? ; dfstruct(); 
##??diff (papertrail; setdiff2 {prob} or {compare} using github green/red & darkgreen/darkred colouring approach; 'dataview'; split-window with side-by-side display as in diffPDF; what happens when the two df have different nr of rows/columns?; also diff two variables within data.frame?; preview pane with head(X, 20) including class/mode, etc.; )
##??replace2 (gui for replacement tables); merge; 
##??diff (papertrail; setdiff2 {prob} using github green/red & darkgreen/darkred colouring approach; 'dataview'; split-window with side-by-side display as in diffPDF; what happens when the two df have different nr of rows/columns?; also diff two variables within data.frame?; display all.equal() results and doublecheck with identical() on subset; dfdiff(); )
##??ulabel -- graphically update label (in style of clabel); how deal with cbind() that discards label? maybe store in special object that documents all up-to-date labelled objs in workspace; append 'last modified on date time'; 
##!!come up with Test data frame with NAs, NA vars, different data structures, labels, etc.
##??poor man's loop constructor/debugger/sandbox with automatic interpretation of variables and display of obtained values and working on a head() subset of original input; loop workflow; apply() funs; 
##??poor man's formula constructor, given a df; look into Rcmdr for an implementation; allow for * : etc. constructs, maybe by using groupings; log the reproducible, generated command; see pmg; 
##??investigate dffilter() compatibility with data.table package
##??melt/dcast gui for pivot tables (this is still exploratory so fits the scope of the package); use margins et al.; OR use 'tables' tabular() and provide latex/html export & reproducible code
