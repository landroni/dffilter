 - !!Reload data.frame button
    - restore actual selection of row filters after checking that structure has not changed
        - adding new filter should consider merged changes 
        - when modifying a level and merging changes, it should automatically update the filters
    - implement digest
        - if digest has NOT changed then on 'reload' simply display a statusbar message, OR disable 'reload'
        - ??auto-polling of the data frame? 
    - reload fails if loaded df is not in workspace: df[ subs, ]
		- check if get('df') works, if not disable 'Reload' button and set editable=F
    - FIXME investigate cache bug: 
        - dffilter(Xa); Xa$var[1:10,] <- NA; dffilter(Xa) 
            without closing first instance. 
        - Or dffilter(cbind(Xa, Xb)). 
    - editable=T: when making object copy, save digest, then before saving changes in workspace, 
        check if digest of object is still the same and if not inform the user that 
        the object had already been modified and ask for additional confirmation 

 - !!make.names() & set editable=F & message to inform user

 - ?? Details speed-up: display gdf() only on focus of Debug tab (<- NULL after display)
 - FIXME Details: dynamic height for expandgp: same as 'label' if <7 lines; else 7 lines
 - improve "Name is not a match" UI (- currently in gfilter.R, when adding a filter, if you enter a wrong variable name in the input box (say, 'asdf'), then you get name is not a match message in the console. It would be nicer UI to have a red label in the dialogue)
    - FIXME disable OK button in gbasicdialog() ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24711369/how-to-disable-ok-button-in-gbasicdialog-instance-of-gwidgets2/ )

gfilter.R TODO items:
 - ??sort variable components? or use data frame order?
     - add 'sort items' toggle button in filter
 - !!inspect the gfilter code (logical vector selection, use spinners for 'range' & type-ahead updating of filters, manually update filter items to reflect available choices as a 'update filters' button or 'freeze selection' checkbox?)
 - !!inspect the gfilter code (logical vector selection, use spinners for 'range', manually update filter items to reflect available choices as a 'update filters' button or 'freeze selection' checkbox?)
 - !!gfilter generic preset (use c("==", "%in%", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", "<=") combo, logical / manual subset)
 - ??stringr (for options 'whole word' in search; replacement for grepl(); )
 - tmp sort & re-order columns in gdf() via c-menu
 - bug with "" in sinlge filter if "" is part of levels

#############################################
Medium priority / soon:
 - ??use dnd to re-order columns in list, for display purposes & tooltip
 - ??intersection/union checkbox in gfilter.R
 - ??tooltip nr of uniq items for variable filters
 - !!bar handle to resize height of var box
 - !!tmp re-sort of displayed subset (perhaps via a drop-menu or in gdf())
 - !!toggle button to display only unique()/duplicated2() matches (can gdf() support this?)
 - !!use new_item_handler to handle the auto-resize of pane issue (on 'add item')
###
 - !!throttle requests from preset (see #40)
 - REQ highlight gdf() columns (see #12)
 - !!dfdiff() functionality on Merge; check if subset objs are identical; use all.equal() and identical() on subset
 - ??optimize return() beahviour, confirmation, on-the-fly, discard/save&close button, undo/redo, display diff before confirm merge, etc.
 - ??what happens when view/edit 'other' classes (Date & robustness of gdf()); 
    - investigate sapply() thingy & factor editor robustness (strange handling of inserting NA values, especially in 'char' vars)
 - ??some sort of weird --detach-- pop-up to have more scrolling space to choose column names, and maybe to re-arrange them for displaying purposes. 
 - ??theme dependent colors
 - ??Details speed-up: if sel is same as full, do nothing 
    - unlikely in big data frames, irrelevant in small ones
 - document `initial.vars` in gfilter()


#############################################
Low priority / maybe / later:
 - !!export subset ("save as" different obj)
	- save details output to text file
 - ??compat with other GUIs: 
    - rstudio usage ideas: View <- dffilter
    - REQ Rcmdr option for viewer editor
 - !!check compatibility with tcltk
 - ??investigate dffilter() compatibility with data.table package & plm
 - ??possible to use Rgtk2Extras widget (rgtk2editdf)
 - ??what of 5gb dataset or 21297 integer levels: 
    - it shouldn't be too slow; 
    - if possible use max 1 copy/subs of df; 

 - ??on display button, log subsetting operation in the console or Log window
    - log commands and/or print commands 
 - ??data frame selector (use data frame browser; what about matrix objs?) & label(..., self=T) in tooltip and make  label editable & describe() & class() & nchar() & clone obj & save obj as .RData/csv/etc. & 
 - ??data frame selector (use data frame browser; what about matrix objs?) & label(..., self=T) in tooltip and make  label editable & describe() & class() & nchar() & auto-load on package load & allow to set gtimer(check_digest) on data frames or maybe allow to set polling using digests on specific objects/subsets; debug var with nchar, etc.; allow to compare to variables, even when vars from two different data frames (all.equal()); allow to compare two objects (all.equal()); 
 - ??diff (papertrail; setdiff2 {prob} or {compare} using github green/red & darkgreen/darkred colouring approach; 'dataview'; split-window with side-by-side display as in diffPDF; what happens when the two df have different nr of rows/columns?; also diff two variables within data.frame?; preview pane with head(X, 20) including class/mode, etc.; )
 - ??diff (papertrail; setdiff2 {prob} using github green/red & darkgreen/darkred colouring approach; 'dataview'; split-window with side-by-side display as in diffPDF; what happens when the two df have different nr of rows/columns?; also diff two variables within data.frame?; display all.equal() results and doublecheck with identical() on subset; dfdiff(); )
 - ??replace2 (gui for replacement tables); merge; plyr join
 - ??poor man's loop constructor/debugger/sandbox with automatic interpretation of variables and display of obtained values and working on a head() subset of original input; loop workflow; apply() funs; 
 - ??poor man's formula constructor, given a df; look into Rcmdr for an implementation; allow for * : etc. constructs, maybe by using groupings; log the reproducible, generated command; see pmg; 
 - ??include subset feature in latticist
###
- !!Structure
	- allow dfstr()
    - edit data structure:
		- w/o displaying data frame (Deducer-style?)
		- rename & sort & re-order variables/cols, 
		- change var type/factors, edit factors, 
		- batch rename cols (tolower), etc. 
		- dfstruct(); 
		- mutate(), copy vars, create new vars by transforming existing var; 
		- sort & re-order columns
    - label(..., self=T) 
        - ulabel -- graphically update label (in style of clabel); 
        - FIXME how deal with cbind() that discards label? 
            - maybe store in special object that documents all up-to-date labelled objs in workspace; 
        - append 'last modified on date time'; 
    - melt/cast thingy using reshape2
