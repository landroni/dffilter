Title: gWidgets2 GUI to view, search, subset and edit a data frame in R (alpha)
Author: Liviu Andronic
Maintainer: Liviu Andronic <landronimirc@gmail.com>
Depends: gWidgets2 (>= 1.0-6), gWidgets2RGtk2 (>= 1.0-3)
Description: The GUI allows the user to search and filter rows in a data frame, select only the desired columns and display the resulting subset. Optionally the user can edit the subset and merge the changes into the original data frame (experimental). 

At the moment the software is alpha, and the editing feature is ***experimental***. Testers welcome.
